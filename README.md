# SC1007 Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository includes my personal take on the tutorial/assignments/labs. As far as possible, I refrain from using the functions given in implementing my solutions (although I should), to solidify my knowledge on linked lists or whatever is implemented.

The codes here are indicative and not exhaustive, and is just a means to keep track of what I could have done better as I reflect on my codes.

Feel free to reach out if there can be any improvements :)
